{"Name":"HockeyApp for Android","Id":2443,"Alias":"hockeyappandroid","Description":"HockeyApp a platform to collect live crash reports, get feedback from your users, distribute your betas, recruit new testers, and analyze your test coverage.\n\n## Features\n \n - **Crash Reports** - Reliable and complete crash reporting for beta and App Store versions, providing full server-side symbolication with class names, methods, line numbers, and automatic grouping of similar crash reports.\n - **Feedback** - Allows you to communicate with your customers. Users can create a support request, post an idea, or discuss a problem right from within the app.\n - **Distribution** - Upload your beta versions to HockeyApp and distribute them to your beta testers. Integrate our open-source SDK and your app will automatically be able to detect updates and offer the updates right within the app.\n - **Analytics** - Advanced metrics to get a better overview of the testing for your app. See which devices were tested, which testers used the app for how long, and which language was tested.\n \n\n## Learn More\nLearn more about HockeyApp by visiting http://hockeyapp.net","Version":"3.7.0.0","Summary":"HockeyApp is a platform to collect live crash reports, get feedback from your users, distribute your betas, recruit new testers, and analyze your test coverage.","QuickStart":"## Adding HockeyApp to your Android app\nOpen your `AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following line as a child element of the tag `application`:\n\n```\n\u003cactivity android:name=\"net.hockeyapp.android.UpdateActivity\" /\u003e\n```\n\nAdd the following permissions to your app.  You can add them in your project settings, or by adding the xml directly to your AndroidManifest.xml or by adding the following attributes somewhere in your app:\n\n```\n[assembly: UsesPermission(Android.Manifest.Permission.Internet)]\n[assembly: UsesPermission(Android.Manifest.Permission.WriteExternalStorage)]\n```\n\nHockeyApp was designed to catch unhandled/uncaught ***java*** exceptions, and doesn\u0027t really know much about Xamarin.Android.  So, if you want HockeyApp to catch your Managed .NET exceptions, you need to help it do so.  A good way to do this is to globally handle the .NET `UnhandledException` and `UnobservedTaskException` events.  The event handlers for these events should call the `HockeyApp.ManagedExceptionHandler.SaveException (..)` helper method.  Here is an example:\n\n```\npublic class MainActivity : Activity\n{      \n    public const string HOCKEYAPP_APPID = \"YOUR-APP-ID\";\n\n\tprotected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)\n\t{\n\t\tbase.OnCreate (bundle);\n\n        // Register the crash manager before Initializing the trace writer\n        HockeyApp.CrashManager.Register (this, HOCKEYAPP_APPID); \n\n        //Register to with the Update Manager\n        HockeyApp.UpdateManager.Register (this, HOCKEYAPP_APPID);\n\n        // Initialize the Trace Writer\n        HockeyApp.TraceWriter.Initialize ();\n\n        // Wire up Unhandled Expcetion handler from Android\n        AndroidEnvironment.UnhandledExceptionRaiser += (sender, args) =\u003e \n        {\n            // Use the trace writer to log exceptions so HockeyApp finds them\n            HockeyApp.TraceWriter.WriteTrace(args.Exception);\n            args.Handled = true;\n        };\n\n        // Wire up the .NET Unhandled Exception handler\n        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException +=\n            (sender, args) =\u003e HockeyApp.TraceWriter.WriteTrace(args.ExceptionObject);\n\n        // Wire up the unobserved task exception handler\n        TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException += \n            (sender, args) =\u003e HockeyApp.TraceWriter.WriteTrace(args.Exception);\n\n\n        // ...\n\t\t\n\t}\n}\n```","Hash":"9075bd2d3cd9ba712f1c07b4b7d149ee","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
